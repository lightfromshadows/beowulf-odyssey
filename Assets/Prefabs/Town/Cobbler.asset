    soles, holes, and knotter of laces."

  choice:
  - Mender of souls, I pray to you ever night. Am I saved?
  - "My shoes need some mending for sure. I\u2019ve been walking for ages."
  - My shoes could use a shining but not much else. How much will it cost?
  responses:
  - "You\u2019re funny, I like it. Here, your shoes look a bit worn. Take these, can\u2019t
    have a hero such as yourself without a strong soul."
  - "I can tell from your shoes that you\u2019ve been walking only ten miles or so.
    A cobbler might beat shoes but he\u2019s not beat in the head!"
  - "A pretty penny for a pretty shining, but you\u2019re in luck. I\u2019ve lowered
    my prices to just 100 coins a shoe. Maybe next time you\u2019ll have something
    more in your purse than lint."
