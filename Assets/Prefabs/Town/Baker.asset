  choice:
  - I was wondering if you could direct me to the werewolf?
  - Baking bread and folding flour, you do anything useful here?
  - "I\u2019d like a loaf please"
  responses:
  - "The \u2013 the w-werewolf? Well, it\u2019s just outside of town. But you don\u2019t
    want to go chasing it young hero. You have hardly any meat on your bones! Here,
    take this loaf, for your health!"
  - "I\u2019m plenty useful or maybe you\u2019d rather starve! You better not speak
    to the Blacksmith that way or he\u2019ll cut your lips off!"
  - "Sorry, but it looks like you don\u2019t have a coin on you. Hard to come by on
    these hard times. Try knocking on someone else\u2019s door."
