  choice:
  - "I\u2019ve come to kill the werewolf."
  - You think you can talk to me that way?
  - Hey, I just came by to see if you could help me.
  responses:
  - "The werewolf eh?... you\u2019re gonna die hands down. Maybe I\u2019ve got something
    in the back so at least you can go down fighting."
  - Young, weak, and disrespectful. Get the hell out of my doorway.
  - "Sure I can help you, help direct you to the graveyard. You\u2019ll be there soon
    enough."
