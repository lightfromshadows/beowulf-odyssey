  choice:
  - "I\u2019ve come to pray, father."
  - Would you be able to bless me? I might die tonight.
  - How much did this church cost the town?
  responses:
  - I welcome a child of faith. Bend your knee and I shall bless you.
  - To bless the wanting is sin enough. Now leave this place and find your own blessing
    elsewhere.
  - It cost the lives of saints and the tears of widows. Be gone from this holy ground
    for you soil it with your venomous questions.
