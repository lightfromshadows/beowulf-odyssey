  choice:
  - Leather sounds like it would be pretty useful for guarding against werewolf bites.
  - These are high quality! How much for some armor?
  - "Care to make a donation? I promise you won\u2019t get eaten tonight."
  responses:
  - It is. Takes a long time to make too.
  - "At least five hundred coins, but there\u2019s\u2026 something about you. I had
    a friend about your age before the werewolf got \u2018em. Here, take this armor.
    It\u2019ll do you good."
  - "Only the lord can promise such things and you look nothing like the lord. Get
    off my porch and pray you don\u2019t die a sinner!"
